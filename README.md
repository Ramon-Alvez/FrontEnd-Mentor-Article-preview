## My process 💻✒

### Built with 🧱🛠

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned 📚

The challenge was very easy until I had to create the sharing section, this part gave me so much trouble that I was even disappointed to have done the script in 2 minutes 😅😂😂

Well, I know that my script isn't a thing to be proud, but for now that is the way I choose to solve this problem, but I'm looking forward to improve my problem solve capacity. 

Other thing I want to punctuate here is in CSS, I know I could have used GRID to solve this challenge but when I thought that I was ending the page stylization 😅, I'm just so used to Flexbox but I will try to use GRID more in the future.

### Continued development 🚀

Now my plan is to practice JS with Frontend Mentor challenges and continue studying React
